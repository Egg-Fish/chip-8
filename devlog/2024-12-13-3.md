# [2024-12-13-3] Devlog: CHIP-8

# Introduction

With a code structure in place, we can start to implement some of the functions
needed to execute CHIP-8 code.

In this session, my objectives are:
- Implement the `c8_cycle()` function.
- Implement a set of instructions.
- Load a test ROM.
- Display the framebuffer to the terminal.


# The `c8_cycle()` Function

This function will do the following:
1. Fetch 2 bytes from `machine.memory`.
1. Feed the highest 4 bits to a `switch` statement.
1. Execute the instruction.


## Fetch
Instructions are stored big-endian. Therefore the fetch looks like this:

```c
// Fetch
uint16_t instruction_hi = machine->memory[machine->registers.PC];
uint16_t instruction_lo = machine->memory[machine->registers.PC + 1];

uint16_t instruction = instruction_hi << 8 | instruction_lo;

machine->registers.PC += 2;
```

After fetchin an instruction, automatically increment the PC register to the
next instruction.

## Decode
The next part of the code extracts a few values from this 16-bit instruction.

The first nibble (4 bits) of the instruction, which I will name as `T`, represents the type of instruction
being carried out, like addition or display and so on.

The second nibble is named `X`.

The third nibble is named `Y`.

The fourth nibble is named `N`.

The third and fourth nibble combined is named `NN`.

The second, third, and fourth nibble combined is named `NNN`.

- For example, all arithmetic operations start with `T=8`.
- The operands are defined by `X` and `Y`.
- The type of arithmetic operation is defined by `N`.

Depending on the type of operation, different parts of the instruction mean
different things.

To save on complexity, all these values are extracted regardless of the instruction
type.

```c
// Decode
uint8_t  T   = instruction_hi >> 4 & 0xF;
uint8_t  X   = instruction_hi & 0xF;
uint8_t  Y   = instruction_lo >> 4 & 0xF;
uint8_t  N   = instruction_lo & 0xF;
uint8_t  NN  = instruction_lo;
uint16_t NNN = X << 8 | NN;
```

## Execute

As mentioned, the first 4 bits (which is `T`) will be used in a switch statement.

```c
// Execute
switch (T) {
    case 0x0:
        // Instructions for instructions beginning with 0
    case 0x1:
    case 0x2:
    case 0x3:
    case 0x4:
    case 0x5:
    case 0x6:
    case 0x7:
    case 0x8:
    case 0x9:
    case 0xA:
    case 0xB:
    case 0xC:
    case 0xD:
    case 0xE:
    case 0xF:
    default:
        break;
}
```

However, within a case, there sometimes needs to be another switch statement.
- For example, there is only one instruction that starts with 6.
- On the other hand, there are 9 instructions that start with 8.

For now, let us focus on just a small set of instructions

# Instruction: `00E0`

This instruction clears the screen. In other words, set the framebuffer to all
zeros.

```c
case 0x0:
    if (instruction == 0x00E0) {
        memset(machine->framebuffer, 0, C8_FRAMEBUFFER_LEN);
    }

    break;
```

# Instruction: `1NNN`

This instruction sets the PC register to `NNN`.

```c
case 0x1:
    machine->registers.PC = NNN;
    
    break;
```

# Instruction: `6XNN`

This instruction sets the `V[X]` register to `NN`.

Since the machine struct is not an array, indexing becomes abit trickier.

Fortunately, we can just change the struct to make `V` an array instead.

```c
struct c8_machine {
    struct {
        uint8_t V[16];

        uint16_t I;
        uint16_t PC;
    } registers;

// ...
// ...
// ...

case 0x6:
    machine->registers.V[X] = NN;

    break;
```

# Instruction: `7XNN`

This instruction adds `NN` to the `V[X]` register.

There is no carry flag set for this operation.

```c
case 0x7:
    machine->registers.V[X] += NN;

    break;
```

# Instruction: `ANNN`

This instruction sets the `I` register to `NNN`.

```c
case 0xA:
    machine->registers.I = NNN;

    break;
```

# Instruction: `DXYN`

The last instruction to implement in this session is the display call.

This instruction reads `N` bytes, starting from the address in `I`.

These bytes represents the pixels to be drawn. Each byte represents 8 pixels
in a row.
- Therefore, sprites are always 8 pixels wide.

The pixels are then "drawn", starting from the top-left coordinate defined by
(`VX`, `VY`).

There is a wrap-around if the sprite goes off-screen.

In memory, the bytes are XORed onto the framebuffer. If any of the original bits
in the framebuffer becomes 0, the value of the `VF` register is set to 1, else 0.
- You can think of it as a "collision" between pixels.

To aid in this instruction, I have defined the following function:

```c
int c8_display_pixel_draw(c8_machine_t machine, uint8_t pixel_x, uint8_t pixel_y, uint8_t draw_value) {
    int framebuffer_x = pixel_x / 8;
    int framebuffer_y = pixel_y;

    int framebuffer_index = framebuffer_y * 16 + framebuffer_x;

    // Fetch framebuffer byte associated to pixel at (pixel_x, pixel_y)
    uint8_t framebuffer_byte = machine->framebuffer[framebuffer_index];

    // Within the framebuffer byte, select the bit that represents the pixel
    int framebuffer_byte_x = pixel_x % 8;

    // Highest bit is closest to the left side of the screen.
    uint8_t framebuffer_byte_new = framebuffer_byte ^ (draw_value << (7 - framebuffer_byte_x));

    machine->framebuffer[framebuffer_index] = framebuffer_byte_new;

    // If a 1 is flipped to a 0, then the number will be smaller.
    return framebuffer_byte_new < framebuffer_byte;
}
```

This function will draw a single pixel at a pixel coordinate. The return value
is true if there is a pixel that was flipped from 1 to 0.

The final code for this instruction is:

```c
case 0xD:
    uint8_t pixels[16];  // Max N = 0xF

    uint8_t *addr = &machine->memory[machine->registers.I];  // Starting address

    // Read N bytes from memory starting from I
    memcpy(pixels, addr, N * sizeof(uint8_t));

    // Starting coordinates
    uint8_t pixel_x = machine->registers.V[X];
    uint8_t pixel_y = machine->registers.V[Y];

    int has_flipped = 0;
    for (uint8_t i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        uint8_t pixel = pixels[i];
        for (uint8_t j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            has_flipped |= c8_display_pixel_draw(
                machine,
                pixel_x + j,
                pixel_y + i,
                pixel << (7 - j));
        }
    }

    break;
```


# Testing The Emulator

In order to test the emulator, we need to feed it instruction from the memory.

Right now, the program will run indefinitely, and given that the memory is all
zeros, the machine will do nothing.

For now, I will hard-code a custom ROM onto the memory of the machine:

```c
void c8_init(c8_machine_t machine) {
    machine->registers.PC = 0x0200;

    const uint8_t ibm_logo_rom[] = {
        0x00, 0xE0, 0xA2, 0x2A, 0x60, 0x0C, 0x61, 0x08, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0x70, 0x09,
        0xA2, 0x39, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0xA2, 0x48, 0x70, 0x08, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0x70, 0x04,
        0xA2, 0x57, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0x70, 0x08, 0xA2, 0x66, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0x70, 0x08,
        0xA2, 0x75, 0xD0, 0x1F, 0x12, 0x28, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x00, 0x3C, 0x00,
        0x3C, 0x00, 0x3C, 0x00, 0x3C, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF,
        0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0x3F, 0x00, 0x3F, 0x00, 0x38, 0x00, 0xFF, 0x00, 0xFF,
        0x80, 0x00, 0xE0, 0x00, 0xE0, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0xE0, 0x00,
        0xE0, 0x00, 0x80, 0xF8, 0x00, 0xFC, 0x00, 0x3E, 0x00, 0x3F, 0x00, 0x3B,
        0x00, 0x39, 0x00, 0xF8, 0x00, 0xF8, 0x03, 0x00, 0x07, 0x00, 0x0F, 0x00,
        0xBF, 0x00, 0xFB, 0x00, 0xF3, 0x00, 0xE3, 0x00, 0x43, 0xE0, 0x00, 0xE0,
        0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0x80, 0x00, 0xE0, 0x00, 0xE0};

    memcpy(&machine->memory[0x0200], ibm_logo_rom, sizeof(ibm_logo_rom));
}
```

## Displaying The Framebuffer

Without SDL2, we can still display from the terminal.

```c
void c8_draw(c8_machine_t machine) {
    printf("\033[H"); // Move to (0, 0)

    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 16; j++) {

            uint8_t framebuffer_byte = machine->framebuffer[i * 16 + j];

            for (int k = 7; k >= 0; k--) {
                if ((framebuffer_byte >> k) & 1) {
                    printf("##");
                }
                else {
                    printf("  ");
                }
            }
        }

        printf("\n");
    }
}
```

And from this point, we are ready to display our first program!

In the next session, I will implement even more instructions, as well as figure
out how to deal with keypad inputs.
