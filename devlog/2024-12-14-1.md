# Introduction

This session introduces some optimisations of the previous code.

# Draw Calls

## Problem

Every cycle, a draw call is initiated. This clears the screen, reads every byte
from the framebuffer, and renders the data onto the terminal.

For the majority of cycles, there will not be any changes to the framebuffer.
This results in "wasted" draw calls when there are no changes.

## Solution

Introduce a variable `dxyn_called` that is true when the display instruction 
has been called during a cycle.

```c
struct c8_machine {
    // ...

    uint8_t framebuffer[C8_FRAMEBUFFER_LEN];  // 1 row = 16 bytes
    bool dxyn_called; // True when a display instruction was executed

    // ...
};
```

Therefore, instead of calling the draw function every cycle, the emulator will
only render when there is a visible change in the framebuffer:

```c
while (1) {
    c8_handle_input(machine);
    c8_update_timers(machine);
    c8_cycle(machine);

    if (machine->dxyn_called) {
        c8_draw(machine);
        machine->dxyn_called = false;
    }
}
```

# Display Instruction

## Problem

Currently, the `DXYN` instruction makes use of an intermediary function called
`c8_display_pixel_draw()`. This function draws a value to a specific (x, y)
coordinate.

However, in order to effectively write 8 pixels, the function needs to be called
eight times. A single byte can represent these 8 pixels. Drawing to the
framebuffer, then, should not need to iterate every single bit of a byte.

# Solution

An empty framebuffer looks like this:

```
Address:        00       01       02
            |--------|--------|--------|
Data:       |00000000|00000000|00000000|

```

Writing the byte `0b11010010` to pixel coordinates (3, 0) yields

```
Address:        00       01       02
            |--------|--------|--------|
Data:       |00011010|01000000|00000000|

```

By observation, we see that a maximum of two framebuffer bytes are affected
by the operation. A mimimum of one byte is achieved when the x-coordinate is a
multiple of 8.

Therefore, the solution can be broken into this:

```c
{
    int x_offset = x_coordinate % 8;

    uint8_t value_low = byte >> x_offset;
    uint8_t value_high = byte << (8 - x_offset);

    // Sprites wrap around the screen
    int index_low = y_coordinate * 64 + (x_coordinate % 64);
    int index_high = y_coordinate * 64 + ((x_coordinate + 1) % 64);

    bool is_collision = (framebuffer[index_low] & value_low) || (framebuffer[index_high] & value_high);

    framebuffer[index_low] ^= value_low;
    framebuffer[index_high] ^= value_high;

    return is_collision;
}
```

In the example, the `value_` variables would represent the data about to be 
XORed onto address 00 and 01 respectively.

The `is_collision` variable will check if there are any overlapping 'on' bits.
This is used to set VF to be true when there is a collsion.

The `index_` variables simply calculate which framebuffer bytes should be written
to.

Note that if the x-coordinate is a multiple of 8, the value of `value_high` 
becomes 0. Therefore, there are no changes since XORing with 0 will retain the
original value.

The final code is as follows:

```c
case 0xD: {
    machine->dxyn_called = true;
    uint8_t pixels[16];  // Max N = 0xF

    uint8_t *addr = &machine->memory[machine->registers.I];  // Starting address

    // Read N bytes from memory starting from I
    memcpy(pixels, addr, N * sizeof(uint8_t));

    // Starting coordinates
    uint8_t pixel_x = machine->registers.V[X];
    uint8_t pixel_y = machine->registers.V[Y];

    // Offset from the framebuffer byte containing the pixel
    uint8_t pixel_offset = pixel_x % 8;

    uint8_t is_collision = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        uint8_t pixel = pixels[i];

        uint8_t value_low  = (pixel >> pixel_offset) & 0xFF;
        uint8_t value_high = (pixel << (8 - pixel_offset)) & 0xFF;

        int index_low  = (pixel_y % 32) * 8 + (pixel_x % 64) / 8;
        int index_high = (pixel_y % 32) * 8 + ((pixel_x + 8) % 64) / 8;

        is_collision |= machine->framebuffer[index_low] & value_low;
        is_collision |= machine->framebuffer[index_high] & value_high;

        machine->framebuffer[index_low] ^= value_low;
        machine->framebuffer[index_high] ^= value_high;

        pixel_y++;
    }

} break;
```

In the next session, I will continue implementing the other CHIP-8 instructions.
