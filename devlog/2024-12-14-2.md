# [2024-12-14-2] Devlog: CHIP-8

# Introduction

In this session, my objectives are:
- Implement CHIP-8 instructions up to `8XYE`.

There are only 35 of them - this shouldn't take too long.

# Instruction: `00EE`

This instruction pops an address from the stack, and sets the PC register to it.

It is much like a return opcode. Its counterpart is `2NNN`, which will be
implemented later.

In order to implement this, we need to take note of where the top of the stack
is, which will be an additional state in the CHIP-8 machine:

```c
struct c8_machine {
    // ...

    uint16_t stack[C8_STACK_LEN];
    int stack_top;

    // ...
};

void c8_init(c8_machine_t machine) {
    // ...

    machine->stack_top = -1;
}
```

Then the final instruction will look like this:

```c
case 0x0:
    // ...

    if (instruction == 0x00EE) {
        machine->registers.PC = machine->stack[machine->stack_top--];
    }
```

# Instruction: `2NNN`

This instruction pushes the current PC register address to the stack, then sets
the PC register to `NNN`.

This is similar the a call opcode. The value that is pushed to the stack will be
the address of the next instruction, since the PC register is incremented during
the fetch phase.

# Instruction `3XNN`, `4XNN`, `5XY0`, `9XY0`

These are conditional skip instructions.

These will "skip" instructions (by incrementing the PC register by 2) based on 
certain conditions defined by the instruction.

The instruction `3XNN` skips when `V[X]` is equal to `NN`.

The instruction `4XNN` skips when `V[X]` is NOT equal to `NN`.

```c
case 0x3:
    if (machine->registers.V[X] == NN) {
        machine->registers.PC += 2;
    }

    break;
case 0x4:
    if (machine->registers.V[X] != NN) {
        machine->registers.PC += 2;
    }

    break;
```

The instruction `5XY0` skips when `V[X]` is equal to `V[Y]`.

The instruction `9XY0` skips when `V[X]` is NOT equal to `V[Y]`.

```c
case 0x5:
    if (machine->registers.V[X] == machine->registers.V[Y]) {
        machine->registers.PC += 2;
    }

    break;
case 0x9:
    if (machine->registers.V[X] != machine->registers.V[Y]) {
        machine->registers.PC += 2;
    }

    break;
```

# Instructions `8XY?`

These instructions are the arithmetic and logic operations.

All operations store their result in `V[X]`.

The last nibble is used to determine what operation it is. Some instructions 
might not use `V[Y]`.

Because of this, another switch statement on the last nibble (named as `N`) must
be used:

```c
case 0x8:
    switch (N) {
        case 0x0:
        case 0x1:
        case 0x2:
        case 0x3:
        case 0x4:
        case 0x5:
        case 0x6:
        case 0x7:
        case 0xE:

        default:
            break;
    }

    break;
```

Here is a table with all the instructions and their meaning:

| Instruction | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `8XY0`      | Set `V[X] = V[Y]`.                                                         |
| `8XY1`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] \| V[Y]`. Perform bitwise OR between `V[X]` and `V[Y]`.    |
| `8XY2`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] & V[Y]`. Perform bitwise AND between `V[X]` and `V[Y]`.   |
| `8XY3`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] ^ V[Y]`. Perform bitwise XOR between `V[X]` and `V[Y]`.   |
| `8XY4`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] + V[Y]`. Set `V[F] = 1` if there is a carry, else `V[F] = 0`. |
| `8XY5`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] - V[Y]`. Set `V[F] = 0` if there is a borrow, else `V[F] = 1`.|
| `8XY6`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] >> 1`. Store the least significant bit of `V[X]` in `V[F]`. |
| `8XY7`      | Set `V[X] = V[Y] - V[X]`. Set `V[F] = 0` if there is a borrow, else `V[F] = 1`.|
| `8XYE`      | Set `V[X] = V[X] << 1`. Store the most significant bit of `V[X]` in `V[F]`.  |

The final implementation looks like this:

```c
case 0x8:
    switch (N) {
        case 0x0:
            machine->registers.V[X] = machine->registers.V[Y];

            break;
        case 0x1:
            machine->registers.V[X] |= machine->registers.V[Y];

            break;
        case 0x2:
            machine->registers.V[X] &= machine->registers.V[Y];

            break;
        case 0x3:
            machine->registers.V[X] ^= machine->registers.V[Y];

            break;
        case 0x4: {
            uint8_t VX = machine->registers.V[X];
            machine->registers.V[X] += machine->registers.V[Y];

            machine->registers.V[0xF] = machine->registers.V[X] <= VX;
        } break;
        case 0x5: {
            uint8_t VX = machine->registers.V[X];
            machine->registers.V[X] -= machine->registers.V[Y];

            machine->registers.V[0xF] = machine->registers.V[X] <= VX;
        } break;
        case 0x6:
            machine->registers.V[0xF] = machine->registers.V[X] & 0x1;
            machine->registers.V[X]   = machine->registers.V[X] >> 1;

            break;
        case 0x7: {
            uint8_t VX = machine->registers.V[X];
            uint8_t VY = machine->registers.V[Y];

            machine->registers.V[X] = VY - VX;

            machine->registers.V[0xF] = VX <= VY;

        } break;
        case 0xE:
            machine->registers.V[0xF] = (machine->registers.V[X] >> 7) & 0x1;
            machine->registers.V[X]   = machine->registers.V[X] << 1;

            break;
        default:
            break;
    }

    break;
```
