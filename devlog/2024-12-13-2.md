# [2024-12-13-2] Devlog: CHIP-8

# Introduction

In this session, my objectives are:
- Talk about handling CHIP-8 instructions.
- Lay out the initial architecture of the project.
- Start working on foundational code/code structure.

In my previous devlog, I talked about all the components that needs to be
emulated in a CHIP-8 machine.

Now, I will be talking about the actual execution of instructions.

# The Fetch/Decode/Execute Cycle

Every processor, even modern CPUs, run some form of this cycle - Instructions
are fetched from a memory address, the instruction is decoded into control
signals in the CPU, then the instruction is carried out by the different
components according to the signals they receive.


## Fetch

In the CHIP-8 machine, every instruction is 2 bytes wide.
The current instruction is stored in the PC register.

During the fetch phase, the instruction is fetched from the address stored in
the PC register, and also the address after it.

At the end of this phase, the PC register is incremented twice.

## Decode/Execute

In the context of CHIP-8, these are often combined.

In other systems, an instruction might be carried out in multiple ways, depending
on the state of the machine, the actual instruction bytes, and so on. Therefore,
a separate cycle is dedicated to decoding an instruction, and a separate execution
cycle(s) to carry out the instruction. 

In CHIP-8, there are only 35 instructions. Once an instruction is fetched, it 
can be executed immediately.

Therefore, I will refer to this phase as the execution phase.

Together, a fetch and execution phase forms a cycle.

# Code Architecture

I will be using the "c8_" prefix for this project.

## State
Describing a machine is simple - just use a struct.

```c
struct c8_machine {
    struct {
        uint8_t V0;
        uint8_t V1;
        uint8_t V2;
        uint8_t V3;
        uint8_t V4;
        uint8_t V5;
        uint8_t V6;
        uint8_t V7;
        uint8_t V8;
        uint8_t V9;
        uint8_t VA;
        uint8_t VB;
        uint8_t VC;
        uint8_t VD;
        uint8_t VE;
        uint8_t VF;

        uint16_t I;
        uint16_t PC;
        
    } registers;

    uint8_t  memory[4096];
    uint16_t stack[24];

    struct {
        uint8_t DT;
        uint8_t ST;
    } timers;

    uint8_t framebuffer[16 * 32]; // 1 row = 16 bytes

    uint8_t keypad;
};

typedef struct c8_machine *c8_machine_t;
```

This represents all the state in the emulator.

In other systems, there are Instruction Registers that actually hold the current
instruction, as well as Data Latches for reading/writing to data buses. However,
this emulator will not emulate these things.

There is a special register `keypad` that is updated by another piece of emulator
code, for the machine to interface with the user.

## Runtime
The smallest unit of execution will be a fetch-execute cycle. This will happen
during `c8_cycle()`.

In general, the flow of the emulator will look like this:

```c
int main(void) {
    c8_machine_t machine;

    c8_init(machine); // Initialize state of machine

    while(1) {
        c8_handle_input(machine); // Handle keypad inputs
        c8_update_timers(machine); // Update timers based on real-world time
        c8_cycle(machine); // Fetch-execute cycle
        c8_draw(machine); // Draw to a display device (e.g., SDL2, Terminal, ...)
    }

    return 0;
}
```

For now, 

In the next session, I will start to implement some instructions, such as the
display instruction, and get a test ROM up and running on the emulator.
